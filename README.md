# 100DaysOfCode Challenge

Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode challenge repository! This is where I'll be documenting my coding journey over the next 100 days. The challenge involves coding consistently for 100 days and sharing my progress on social media using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.

## About the Challenge

The #100DaysOfCode challenge is a commitment to code for at least an hour every day for 100 days. This challenge not only helps in building a coding habit but also provides an opportunity to learn new technologies, work on projects, and connect with a supportive community of fellow developers.

## Repository Contents

- **Logs**: This directory contains daily logs of my coding activities. Each log includes the date, the time spent coding, what I worked on, and any progress or challenges I faced.

- **Projects**: In this directory, you'll find the coding projects I'm working on during the challenge. Each project will have its own subdirectory with its source code and any necessary documentation.

## Progress

I'll be sharing my daily progress on social media platforms such as Twitter, using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode. Feel free to follow along and provide feedback or encouragement!
