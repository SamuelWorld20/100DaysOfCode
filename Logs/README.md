**Today's Progress:**
I started my #100DaysOfCode challenge today! I learnt about flutter constructors, objects and methods/functions. And I buit project with them.

**Thoughts:**
It feels great to get started on this challenge. I feel its very interesting building apps with flutter. I guess for now I find flutter more interesting than C.

**Challenges:**
I had problems with aligning my texts.
